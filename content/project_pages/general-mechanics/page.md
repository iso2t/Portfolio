# General Mechanics
### General Mechanics: Realistic technology for the modern era.

## Developers
To add General Mechanics to your project as a dependency, add the following to your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = 'ISO2T Maven'
        url = 'https://maven.iso2t.com'
        content {
            includeGroup 'general.mechanics'
        }
    }
}
```
Then, you can add it as a dependency, with `${mc_version}` being your Minecraft version target and `${version}` being the version of General Mechanics you want to use.
```groovy
dependencies {
	// NeoForge
	implementation "general.mechnics:gm-${mc_version}:${version}"

	// Architectury
	modImplementation "general.mechnics:gm-${mc_version}:${version}"
}
```
